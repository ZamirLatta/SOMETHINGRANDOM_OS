A programming challenge to end all other programming challenges (at least for me): building an operating system from scratch.

**Purpose:**
  - Build a 32-bit OS from scratch that is compatible to play old NES games and others that don't require too much ram/performance.
  - Document the process along the way, so that hopefully (I'll remember) and possibly other people can look at what I've built and learn from it.

side note: this is not a school project, it's just something I want to learn more about. 
side note 2: I will use another document on this file to explain and document things, not this one.
